According to Lost's executive producers/writers/showrunners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse, there are two main themes in fourth season: \"the castaways' relationship to the freighter folk\" and \"who gets off the island and the fact that they need to get back\". Lost came under scrutiny from critics in its third season, but the fourth season was acclaimed for its flash-forwards, pace and new characters.\n\nThe season was originally planned to contain 16 episodes; eight were filmed before the start of the 2007-2008 Writers Guild of America strike. Following the strike's resolution, it was announced that only five more episodes would be produced to complete the season; however, the season finale's script was so long that network executives approved the production of a 14th episode as part of a three-hour season finale split over two nights. The fourth season aired Tuesdays at 9:00 pm from January 31 to March 20, 2008 and at 10:00 pm from April 24 to May 15, 2008. The two-hour finale aired at 9:00 pm on May 29, 2008.

Despite their best efforts, war appeared unavoidable, until a new, even more dangerous threat - one that had been quietly rising all along - exploded to the surface: ALIE, the A.I. that ended the world, offered relief from pain and eternal life in the \u201cCity of Light.\u201d But as her ranks grew, it quickly became clear that she was building an army dedicated to controlling all sentient life on Earth. This was no longer a battle between warring factions; it was a fight for humanity itself. Now, a hard truth lands on the shoulders of those who remain. Will they go quietly into the night, or will they find hope and faith in each other, as they face their darkest chapter yet?",
